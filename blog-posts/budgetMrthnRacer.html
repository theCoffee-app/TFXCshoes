                <!-- <img class="centerBlog" style="min-width: 20rem; min-height: 12rem;" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EK-D14rXsAI01fL.jpg:large"/> -->
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Running shoes have gotten very expensive in the past few years. Nike released the Vaporfly for $250, and despite their steep cost, 
                    they sold out instantly. Other brands saw the success Nike was having, and tried to bring their own "Elite", cushioned, carbon-plated 
                    racer to the table, and with the expensive price tag to match.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So that brings us to this new "budget" category, where companies have made alternatives to their "super shoes" at prices that are still 
                    high, just not heart attack inducing. 
                </p>

                <p>With everyone's eyes on the AlphaFly Next%, the Tempo Next% hasn't gotten as much attention. It's a stripped down version of the AlphaFly 
                    that is great for training and tempo days as well as race day. It essentially replaces the Zoom Fly AND the Pegasus Turbo.

                    The midsole is mostly ZoomX with React foam in the heel, and two Nike Air Zoom Units in the forefoot. Oh, and of course there's a plate in there as well, but it's composite instead of carbon.

                <p>
                    Everyone is calling the Saucony Endorphin Pro the "Vaporfly Killer".  It uses the same midsole material, a carbon plated midsole, and is lightweight, 
                    AND it's $50 cheaper. What people are overlooking is the Endorphon Speed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Saucony Endorphin Speed is almost identical to the Endorphin Pro, but replaces the carbon plate with a TPU plate, and adds a more supportive and 
                    padded upper, for $40 less. 
                </p>
						<p>
						<ul class="disc-bullet">
							<h6>Upper</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
							The upper is lightly padded and structured, but still light and minimal.
							</li>
							<h6>Midsole</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
                                The midsole uses Saucony's PWRRUN PB midsole which is compressed pellets of PeBa foam. Along with a rocker-ed shape, buried inside is an 
                                "S" shaped carbon-fiber plate. 
							</li>
							<h6>Outsole</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
							The outsole has a lot of forefoot coverage and is a durable rubber compound. 
							</li>
                        </ul>
                            <h6>Price: $160</h6>

                <br/>
                <p>Hoka was early to the carbon plate game. It released the Carbon Rocket a few years ago, and it now has a few different models of carbon plated running shoes. 
                    The Carbon X is their highest cushioned, carbon-plated racer, and with the amount of cushioning on this guy, and it's sub $200, price point, 
                    it may appeal to more people than the less cushioned Rocket X which costs $200.  
                </p>
						<p>
						<ul class="disc-bullet">
							<h6>Upper</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
							The upper is a light-weight and breathable racing type upper.
							</li>
							<h6>Midsole</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
							The midsole has a softer layer on the top half, and a firmer, more propulsive bottom layer with a carbon plate sandwiched in-between. 
							</li>
							<h6>Outsole</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
							The outsole is just a continuation of the midsole and is a ruberized foam.

				<div class="date">Image: brooks.com</div>
                <br/>
                <p>This is one of the few models on the list without a carbon plate, but it's still an excelent light weight racer, almost like a racing flat 
                    before they had plates and thick midsoles. The higher end version of this guy, the Brooks Hyperion Elite 2, is a whopping hundred dollars more, and 
                    provides the same midsole material, but with a carbon plate and larger stack height.                      
                </p>
						<p>
						<ul class="disc-bullet">
							<h6>Upper</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
							The upper is very minimal and brethable with a thin tongue. Very racing flat-esque.
							</li>
							<h6>Midsole</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
							The midsole introduces a new foam for Brooks, DNA Flash. It's nitrogen infused EVA that is super light and a bit livelier than typical EVA.  
							</li>
							<h6>Outsole</h6>
							<li class="inside-bullet">
							The outsole has thin pieces of rubber covering the forefoot, and strips in the heel.
